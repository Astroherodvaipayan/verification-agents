# Verifiable AI Agent Framework : Version 0 

## The Critical Need for Verifiable AI

### Trust Without Transparency Isn't Trust

Today's AI systems operate as black boxes, making decisions with little visibility into their data sources, reasoning processes, or execution pathways. This lack of transparency creates significant risks:

- **Data integrity cannot be guaranteed** without verifiable proof of what information an AI agent consumed
- **Accountability becomes impossible** when there's no cryptographic trail of an agent's actions
- **Attribution is challenging** without verifiable agent identities tied to responsible entities

## Verifiability as the Foundation of Trusted AI

Verifiability serves as the missing piece in the AI ecosystem, enabling agents to operate with unprecedented levels of trust:

- **Transparent Decision Trails**: Our framework enables users to backtrace exactly how an AI agent arrived at its conclusions, creating accountability for every action

- **Provable Authenticity**: Through cryptographic proofs, we demonstrate that agent actions are genuinely autonomous and not manipulated by hidden human operators—essential for establishing trusted agentic systems

- **Immutable Reputation**: By anchoring agent identities and attestations on-chain, we create an indelible record of agent behavior that builds cumulative trust over time

## 1. GitHub Agent

The **GitHub Agent** is built on top of the Sentient Agent Framework and performs the following tasks:

1. **Fetch**: Uses the GitHub API to retrieve the raw README.md from one or more repository URLs.
2. **Vectorize** (optional extension): Builds a vector store from README content for retrieval‑augmented summarization.
3. **Summarize**: Produces a concise summary of each repository.

### Setup & Usage

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/your-org/verifiable_agent_demo.git
cd verifiable_agent_demo

# 2. Create & activate venv
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Run the agent server
python app.py

# 5. Query the agent
curl -N http://localhost:8000/assist \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"session":{…},"query":{"id":"","prompt":"https://github.com/user/repo"}}'
```

Logs will show each README fetched and the generated summary.

## 2. Identity Registry

The **Identity Registry** is a smart contract that maintains a mapping from `keccak256(agentDID)` to a list of claims (topics and data).

### Contract: `IdentityRegistry.sol`

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.19;

contract IdentityRegistry {
    struct Claim { bytes32 topic; bytes data; uint256 timestamp; }
    mapping(bytes32 => Claim[]) public claims;

    function claim(bytes32 id, bytes32 topic, bytes calldata data) external {
        claims[id].push(Claim(topic, data, block.timestamp));
    }
}
```

### Deployment

1. **Install Hardhat**
   ```bash
   npm init -y
   npm install --save-dev hardhat @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers ethers dotenv
   npx hardhat  # select "Create an empty hardhat.config.js"
   ```
2. **Configure** your `hardhat.config.js` with your RPC and private key in `.env`.
3. **Compile & Deploy**
   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy_registry.js --network 
   ```
4. **Save** the deployed address to `.env → REGISTRY_ADDR`.

## 3. Input Validation & Commitment

This module creates an **inputRoot** from your agent's raw inputs, issues a Verifiable Credential, and anchors the root on‑chain.

### A. Compute the Input‑Root

```bash
# Generate the unsigned credential payload
python scripts/make_input_root_cred.py \
  https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum \
  https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain \
> proofs/cred.json
```

This script:
- Fetches each README
- SHA‑256 hashes each text
- Sorts the digests and hashes the concatenation into `inputRoot`
- Outputs a pure JSON VC payload to `proofs/cred.json`

### B. Issue the Verifiable Credential

Using DIDKit (Dockerized):

```bash
# Remove any stale proofs
rm -f proofs/inputRoot-*.json

# Issue & sign the VC
docker run --rm -i \
  -v "$(pwd)":/data -w /data \
  ghcr.io/spruceid/didkit-cli:latest \
  credential issue --key-path .agent_key.jwk \
   proofs/inputRoot-.json
```

Verify the credential:
```bash
didkit credential verify proofs/inputRoot-.json
# Should report {"checks":["proof"],"warnings":[],"errors":[]}
```

### C. Anchor On‑Chain

```bash
python scripts/publish_input_root_tx.py
```

This script:
- Reads the `` from the filename
- Builds a transaction calling `registry.claim( keccak256(agentDID), keccak256("inputRoot"), bytes(root) )`
- Signs & sends it with `OWNER_KEY`
- Prints the transaction hash

Verify on‑chain:
```bash
python scripts/verify_onchain.py
# Confirms topic == keccak256("inputRoot") and data == root
```

# 4. Execution Logging & Verifiable Execution Root

## Step 1: Emit & Collect Execution Events

The first step is capturing and hashing every significant event that occurs during agent execution:

- User prompts and inputs
- Tool calls with parameters
- LLM inputs and outputs (potentially chunked)
- Timestamps and relevant metadata

These events are collected into a JSON file structure like this:

```json
{
  "leaves": [
    "0xabc123…",    
    "0xdef456…",    
    "0x7890ab…",    
    "0xcdef12…"     
  ]
}
```

Each leaf represents a cryptographic hash of an execution event, creating tamper-evident records of each step in the agent's process. This approach ensures that if any step is manipulated, its corresponding hash will change, breaking the verification chain.

## Step 2: Build Merkle Tree & Compute Execution Root

Once all execution events are collected, we construct a Merkle tree and generate a zero-knowledge proof to demonstrate the tree was built correctly:

```bash
# Compile the Circom circuit (one-time setup)
circom circuits/merkleTree.circom --r1cs --wasm --sym -o build

# Generate witness from your execution_tree.json
node build/merkleTree_js/generate_witness.js \
  build/merkleTree.wasm \
  execution_tree.json \
  witness.wtns

# Produce proof & public inputs
snarkjs groth16 prove \
  build/merkleTree_final.zkey \
  witness.wtns \
  proofs/proof_execution.json \
  public.json

# Verify locally
snarkjs groth16 verify \
  verification_key.json \
  public.json \
  proofs/proof_execution.json
```

The Merkle tree structure enables efficient verification while maintaining privacy. As described in the research agenda, this approach:

1. Creates a compact representation (the root) of all execution steps
2. Allows for efficient verification without revealing all execution details
3. Ensures that any tampering with execution logs would invalidate the root

The first entry in the generated `public.json` file is the executionRoot, which serves as a succinct cryptographic commitment to the entire execution trace.

## Step 3: Issue a Verifiable Credential for the Execution Root

Next, we wrap the executionRoot in a W3C Verifiable Credential, digitally signed by the agent:

```bash
# Remove old VCs
rm -f proofs/executionRoot-*.json

# Issue the VC
docker run --rm -i \
  -v "$(pwd)":/data -w /data \
  ghcr.io/spruceid/didkit-cli:latest \
  credential issue --key-path .agent_key.jwk \
   proofs/executionRoot-${EXEC_ROOT}.json
{
  "@context":["https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1"],
  "id":"urn:executionRoot:${EXEC_ROOT}",
  "type":["VerifiableCredential","ExecutionRoot"],
  "issuer":"${AGENT_DID}",
  "issuanceDate":"$(date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ")",
  "credentialSubject":{"executionRoot":"${EXEC_ROOT}"}
}
EOF

# Verify the VC
didkit credential verify proofs/executionRoot-${EXEC_ROOT}.json
```

This step establishes the agent's identity and binds it cryptographically to the execution root. The Verifiable Credential format provides:

1. A standardized, portable record of the execution
2. Cryptographic proof of who issued it (the agent's DID)
3. Tamper-evident packaging that can be verified by any party

As the research agenda notes in the "Agent Identity Verification" section, this ensures that final decisions are bound to a trusted entity through digital signatures, with the corresponding public key pre-registered on the blockchain.

## Step 4: Anchor the Execution Root On-Chain

Finally, we commit the executionRoot to an on-chain registry for permanent, tamper-proof storage:

```bash
python3 scripts/publish_execution_root_tx.py --root ${EXEC_ROOT}
```

This script performs four critical operations:

1. Hashes the agent's DID and the topic "executionRoot"
2. Calls `registry.claim(agentHash, topicHash, bytes(root))`
3. Signs and broadcasts the transaction with the agent's OWNER_KEY
4. Emits the transaction hash for auditability


> By following these steps, you have a fully decentralized, transparent, and verifiable pipeline for your AI agent—from data ingestion to on‑chain proof.
